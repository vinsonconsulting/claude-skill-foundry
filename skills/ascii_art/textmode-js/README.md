## What it does

This skill builds real-time textmode graphics in the browser with `textmode.js`, a
zero-dependency WebGL2 library that renders to a grid of character cells with
p5.js-style ergonomics. It covers the create/setup/draw lifecycle, glyph and color
cells, animation and noise, layers, custom GLSL shaders, and export to TXT, SVG,
PNG, GIF, MP4, or WebM.

## Install

Copy the skill folder into a place Claude reads skills.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinsonconsulting/jims-filing-cabinet-of-claude-skills
cp -r jims-filing-cabinet-of-claude-skills/skills/ascii_art/textmode-js ~/.claude/skills/
```

Use `.claude/skills/` inside a project to scope it to one repo instead of your user.

## Example

Describe a sketch and the skill writes the lifecycle.

> Make a full-screen textmode sketch driven by a noise-field glyph ramp.

The skill scaffolds `textmode.create({...})` with `setup` and `draw`, sets
`char`/`charColor`/`cellColor` per cell, and samples a noise field to pick glyphs
from a ramp each frame. It flags the common trip-up up front: the origin `(0,0)` is
the grid center, not the top-left.
