Small, self-contained skills a model loads on demand. Clone, copy a folder, done.

## What this is

A filing cabinet of Claude skills. Each one is a small folder with a `SKILL.md`
and whatever scripts, references, or assets it needs. Claude reads the description
to decide when a skill applies, then follows the instructions inside. The skills
are written for Claude and stay portable, so you can drop a folder into your own
setup and it works.

## Using a skill

A skill is the folder that holds `SKILL.md`. Take the folder, not the category
above it.

**Claude Code.** Copy the skill folder into a place Claude Code reads skills, such
as `~/.claude/skills/` for yourself or `.claude/skills/` inside a project. Claude
loads each skill's `name` and `description`, then pulls in the body when the
description matches what you are doing.

**Claude in the browser (Chat and Projects).** Add the `SKILL.md`, plus any files
it points to, to a Project's knowledge, or paste it into a conversation. The
description is the part that tells Claude when the steps apply, so keep it.

## What's inside

<!-- SKILLS-INDEX:START -->

### ascii_art

| Skill | Description | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ascii-img-react` | Use when rendering images as ASCII art in the browser or a React app with the ascii-img-react library — the shape-vector (not brightness-ramp) approach that keeps edges sharp. Trigger when ascii-img-react or <AsciiImage> is named; when the user wants an image-to-ASCII React component, a terminal/retro ASCII image effect on a web page, a click-ripple or rain ASCII animation over an image, or to theme ASCII output via CSS variables; or when they reach for the low-level utilities (sampleCell, sampleGrid, sampleExternalCircles, findBestCharacter, CachedCharacterLookup, applyGlobalContrast / applyDirectionalContrast, NORMALIZED_CHARACTERS). Covers install, the <AsciiImage> props, CORS/sizing/performance caveats, CSS-variable theming, Astro/Next integration, and the 6D shape-vector technique it implements. Not for converting an image file to ASCII from the command line in Python (use image-to-ascii), and not for real-time generative textmode graphics on a WebGL grid (use textmode-js). | `skills/ascii_art/ascii-img-react/` |
| `image-to-ascii` | Use when converting an image file to ASCII art outside the browser — a command-line or script run that turns a photo, logo, screenshot, or render into text, saved as .txt or rendered to .png/.svg. Trigger on "make ASCII art of this image/photo/cat", "convert this picture/logo to ASCII", "turn this PNG into an ASCII text file for my README", batch-converting a folder of images to ASCII, or any Python/Pillow image-to-ASCII task. Produces sharp, shape-aware output by matching each cell to the glyph whose shape fits best (6D shape vectors + nearest-neighbour, optional contrast enhancement) rather than a naive brightness ramp, and bundles a monospace font for deterministic results. Runs scripts/image_to_ascii.py. Not for ASCII graphics on a web page or in React (use ascii-img-react), not the real-time textmode.js library (use textmode-js), and not figlet-style text banners (this converts images, not words). | `skills/ascii_art/image-to-ascii/` |
| `textmode-js` | Use when building real-time ASCII or textmode graphics in the browser with the textmode.js library — generative glyph-grid sketches, retro/terminal visuals, audio-reactive or VJ textmode, or turning images and video into ASCII on a WebGL2 character grid. Trigger whenever textmode.js is named, when a sketch calls textmode.create, t.setup/t.draw, t.grid, t.char/charColor/cellColor, glyph ramps, or character-cell rendering, or when the user wants to build, debug, or export a grid-of-characters visual. Covers UMD/ESM setup, the setup/draw/resize lifecycle, drawing primitives, char and color cells, print and glyph ramps, animation and noise, layers, filters, custom GLSL ES 3.00 shaders, media conversion, and export to TXT/SVG/PNG/GIF/MP4/WebM. Not for generic ASCII art or Python image-to-ASCII — this is specifically the textmode.js JavaScript/TypeScript library. | `skills/ascii_art/textmode-js/` |

### tui

| Skill | Description | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bubbletea` | Use this skill when building a terminal UI (TUI) in Go with Bubble Tea and the Charm stack — the Elm Architecture / MVU pattern (`tea.Model` with `Init`/`Update`/`View`), `Cmd`/`Msg` event flow, Lip Gloss styling and layout, Bubbles components (`viewport`, `list`, `table`, `textinput`, `textarea`, `spinner`, `progress`), Glamour markdown rendering, and teatest for testing. Especially apt for streaming tokens from an LLM/agent into a terminal (goroutine → `p.Send` → `Update` → `viewport`), an agentic CLI, or any interactive full-screen or inline terminal app in Go. Targets v2 on the `charm.land/*/v2` import paths (Go 1.25+); writes current-version-correct code and avoids v1/beta patterns. Not for: Rust TUIs (→ Ratatui sibling), Python TUIs (→ Textual sibling), plain non-interactive CLI output (use `fmt`/`cobra`/standalone `lipgloss`), web/GUI UIs, or agent session orchestration / tmux / process multiplexing. | `skills/tui/bubbletea/` |
| `ratatui` | Use this skill for any task involving a Rust terminal/text user interface (TUI) built with Ratatui (or crossterm) — creating one, or debugging, fixing, testing, or extending an existing one. Covers: scaffolding the initial `main`/render loop and terminal setup; fixing teardown so a panic or crash doesn't leave the terminal in raw mode / broken; laying out panels, sidebars, status bars, dashboards, and popups with Layout/Constraint; wiring widgets like List, Table, Gauge, Chart, Scrollbar (including selection/scroll state that won't move); styling, text wrapping, and Unicode width issues; streaming LLM/async output into a terminal; and unit-testing rendered output without a real terminal. Triggers on "rust + terminal app/UI/dashboard", ratatui, crossterm. Writes current Ratatui 0.30+ code, not stale tui-rs patterns. Not for: Go TUIs (Bubble Tea), Python TUIs (Textual), non-interactive CLI output or progress bars, web/browser UIs, image-to-ASCII art (ascii/textmode), or tmux/agent-session orchestration. | `skills/tui/ratatui/` |
| `textual` | Use this skill when building or debugging a Python terminal UI (TUI) with Textual (Textualize's framework) — `App`/`Screen`/`Widget`, `compose()`, `reactive`/`watch_`, `@work` workers, Textual CSS / TCSS (`dock`, `grid`, `fr` units), widgets like `RichLog`, `Markdown`, `DataTable`, `Input`, `TextArea`, `Tree`, `ListView`; testing with `Pilot` / `pytest-textual-snapshot`; `textual serve` / Textual Web deploy; Rich renderables inside Textual; or streaming LLM/agent tokens into a terminal and agentic-CLI front-ends. Triggers: Textual, Textualize, TUI, terminal UI, `@work`, TCSS, `RichLog`, `query_one`, Pilot, `textual serve`. Writes current 8.x code, not stale pre-1.0 patterns. Not for: Rust TUIs (→ Ratatui sibling), Go TUIs (→ Bubble Tea sibling), plain non-interactive CLI output (Click/argparse/Typer) with no live UI, or agent-session orchestration / tmux multiplexing. Note: browser deploy via `textual serve` (the same Textual app served to a browser) IS in scope — a general React/HTML web-app request is not. | `skills/tui/textual/` |

<!-- SKILLS-INDEX:END -->

The table above is generated from the skill folders by `make index`. Do not edit
between the markers by hand.

## Layout

```
skills/<category>/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md            # required: frontmatter (name + description) + instructions
  reference/          # optional: docs the skill points to
  scripts/            # optional: helper scripts the skill runs
  assets/             # optional: templates, fonts, samples
```

The `description` in the frontmatter is what a model matches against to decide
whether to load the skill, so write it about when to use the skill, not only what
it does. Folders under `skills/` whose name starts with `_` (like `_TEMPLATE`) are
ignored by the tooling.

## Working on the cabinet

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make lint` | Validate every `SKILL.md`: frontmatter, layout, reference links, trigger language |
| `make index` | Rewrite the skills table and the count badge above |
| `make check` | Lint, then verify the table and badge are current. This is what CI runs |

Start a new skill with `cp -r skills/_TEMPLATE skills/<category>/<name>`, edit the
`SKILL.md`, then run `make check`. CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs the
same check, so a stale index or a lint failure fails the build. More detail lives
in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
